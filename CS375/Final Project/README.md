# CS375_Final_Project
This is the final project for my CS 375 class
Implementing the Graph Generator

Structure for input:
1. ./b.out <output_file> <s> or <d> <verticies>.
  You must specify all of the above arguments for the graph to generate properly
  <s> and <d> are for specifying whether it is a sparse or dense graph


Implementing Floyd Warshall Algorithm

FILE STRUCTURE FOR INPUT: 

First Line: number_of_vertices
Second Line: all_values (with space in between each value)

COMMAND LINE:
1. ./a.out 
2. ./a.out <input_file>
3. ./a.out <input_file> <output_file>

If no input file was specified, then read values from stdin.
If no output file was specified, then write to stdout.
