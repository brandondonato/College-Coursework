1. man - It is a command that describes the command you might want to execute. 
	 It also provides a list of tags that show what else you can specify to the command.		

2. mkdir - This command creates a new directory for someone to store information. 
	   I learned that this command has a parent tag so that you can create a parent directory to 
	   a file that already exists.

3. ls - This command shows all of the contents of a directory that you are already in. 
	I learned that this command has different flags, such as -a or --author, to further specify
	what files you want to look at and who the created the given files.

4. mv - It is a command that can move files from one directory to another as well as rename files.
	I learned that not only can you move files with this command, but you can also update and 
	modify the extentions of files that you choose to move.

5. pwd - This is a command that prints the file name of the directory you are currently in. You can also
	 view the version of the directory you are in.mk
